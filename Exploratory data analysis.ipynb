    "# Exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is the first step towards analysis and model building – finding out what's there and what patterns and relationships there may be. Can help to form questions and areas of exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "* Uncover the structure of the data and how it's coded\n",
    "* Get to know the data by summarising and visualising it\n",
    "* Find outliers, missing data and other issues, deciding how or whether to address them\n",
    "* Find new areas of exploration or analysis\n",
    "* Prepare for model building by checking assumptions, selecting features and choosing the best method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Techniques: \n",
    "* Data inspection – looking at the variable types\n",
    "* Numerical summarisation – su\n",
    "* Visualisation\n",

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are categorical or numerical. Numerical variables are measured and categorical variables are classified by their type. In a dataframe or spreadsheet table, observations are the rows, the variables are the columns and the individual cells are the values.\n",

    "* Ordinal variables, which have an inherent ranking\n",
    "* Binary variables, which have only two possible variations."
