To check this assumption, it is normally sufficient to divide one standard deviation by the other and see if the ratio is “close” to 1. Generally, a ratio between 0.9 and 1.1 should suffice.\n",

    "That said, there is also a way to run a 2-sample t-test without assuming equal standard deviations — for example, by setting the equal_var parameter in the scipy.stats.ttest_ind() function equal to False. Running the test in this way has some disadvantages (it essentially makes it harder to reject the null hypothesis even when there is a true difference between groups), so it’s important to check for equal standard deviations before running the test.\n",
