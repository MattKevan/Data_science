    "What if we’re not happy with just three dimensions? Unfortunately, it becomes pretty difficult to visualize points in dimensions higher than 3. But that doesn’t mean we can’t find the distance between them.\n",

    "The generalized distance formula between points A and B is as follows:\n",
    "Here, A1-B1 is the difference between the first feature of each point. An-Bn is the difference between the last feature of each point.\n",

    "Using this formula, we can find the K-Nearest Neighbors of a point in N-dimensional space! We now can use as much information about our movies as we want.\n",
