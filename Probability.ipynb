    "# Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is a branch of maths that allows us to quantify uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, a set is a collection of things. For example, we can use a set to represent items in a backpack. We might have: \n",
    "\n",
    "{Book,Paper,Folder,Hat,Pen,Snack}\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are notated with curly braces and follow two rules ‚Äì elements are unique and are in no particular order. Therefore: {1,2,3,4,5} = {5,3,2,4,1}\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are often defined with a capital letter:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = {1,2,3,4,5}\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets can also contain subsets. Set A is a subset of set B if all the elements in A exist within B. For example:\n",
    " \n",
    "A = {1,2,3}\n",
    "B = {1,2,3,4,5}\n",
    "‚Äã\t \n",
    "Here, set A is a subset of B because all elements of A are contained within B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiments and sample spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability, an experiment is something that produces observation(s) with some level of uncertainty. A sample point is a single possible outcome of an experiment. A sample space is the set of all possible sample points for an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we flip a coin twice and record whether each flip results in heads or tails, there would be four sample points in t1he experiment: two heads (HH), tails and then heads (TH), heads and then tails (HT), or two tails (TT). The sample space can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "S = {HH,TT,HT,TH}\n",
    "\n",
    "A specific outcome or set of outcomes is an event (E), and a subset of the sample space. Events could include: \n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Two Heads\n",
    "A={HH}\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Two Tails\n",
    "B={TT}\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Both a Heads and Tails\n",
    "C={HT,TH}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating probability \n",
    "‚Äã\n",
    "Probability can be defined as \"If we run an experiment an infinite amount of times, the probability of each event is the proportion of times it occurs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of an event happening is the number of times an event occured divided by the number of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we ran 1000 coin flip experiments and we got two heads 255 times, the probability would be:\n"
